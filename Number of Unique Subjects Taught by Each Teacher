select teacher_id,COUNT(distinct subject_id) as cnt
from teacher
group by teacher_id

EXPLANATION = Breakdown of the Query
1. SELECT Clause:
   - teacher_id: This column is included in the SELECT clause because we need to group the results by each teacher.
   - COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt: This part of the query counts the number of unique subjects (subject_id) each teacher teaches. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that only unique subjects are counted for each teacher. The result is aliased as cnt to represent the count of unique subjects.

2. FROM Clause:
   - teacher: This specifies the table from which the data is being selected.

3. GROUP BY Clause:
   - teacher_id: This groups the results by teacher_id, meaning the query will aggregate data for each teacher separately. For each unique teacher_id, the query counts the distinct subject_id values.

Explanation of the Logic = 
- Grouping: The GROUP BY teacher_id clause groups the data by each teacher. This means all rows with the same teacher_id are considered as a single group.
- Counting Distinct Subjects: Within each group (each teacher), COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) counts the number of distinct subjects taught by that teacher. Using DISTINCT ensures that if a teacher teaches the same subject in different departments, it is only counted once per teacher.
- Result: The query returns a result set where each row represents a teacher and the number of unique subjects they teach.
