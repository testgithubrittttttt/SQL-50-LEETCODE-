# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name from customer where referee_id is null or referee_id!=2

EXPLANATION = 
This SQL query is designed to retrieve the names of customers who are not referred by the customer with id = 2. Let's break down the query step by step:

 1.SELECT name: This part of the query specifies that we want to select the names of customers.

 2.FROM customer: Here, we indicate that we are selecting data from the table named "customer".

 3. WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id != 2: This is the condition we're using to filter the rows from the "customer" table. There are two parts to this condition:
      - referee_id IS NULL: This checks if the referee_id is null. A null referee_id indicates that the customer was not referred by anyone. So, we want to include these customers in our result.
      - OR: This is a logical operator that specifies that either condition must be true for a row to be included in the result.

referee_id != 2: This part of the condition checks if the referee_id is not equal to 2. This means we want to exclude customers who were referred by the customer with id = 2.
