# Write your MySQL query statement below

select distinct author_id as id from Views
where author_id = viewer_id 
order by id;

EXPLANATION = 

- SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id FROM Views: This part of the query selects distinct author_id values from the Views table and aliases it as id. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that unique author_id values are returned, eliminating duplicate entries.

- WHERE author_id = viewer_id: This condition filters the rows where the author_id equals the viewer_id. This means that the viewer and the author are the same person, indicating that the author has viewed the article.

- ORDER BY id: This clause orders the result set by the id (an alias for author_id), arranging the author IDs in ascending order.
